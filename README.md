Final Nodes & Final Edges are datasets for Gephi where we’ve collected data of social network analysis of communities.

Final Nodes (DONT CHANGE!):
Ids’: Id of users which we’ve parsed from pepper.ninja and extra Id’s of media (MK, VZglyad and DOXA)
Labels: name of the media

Final EDGES (DONT CHANGE!):

Target: ids of media we’ve used

Datasets Посты VZгляд, Посты МК, Посты ДОХА are the base that we used to make a word cloud
Посты VZгляд: textes of posts from 24th of February till 23d of June from VZglyad
Посты МК: extes of posts from 24th of February till 23d of June from MK
Посты ДОХА: extes of posts from 24th of February till 23d of June from DOXA
*There are extra 3 datasets. They just have the other type of file.

To revise our social network analysis you should check 2 datasets: Final Nodes & Final Edges

To revise our word cloud you do not need a code. To make a result we use a no-code platform https://www.wordclouds.com/. But before the procedure, we’ve cleaned texts by ourseves with «Find and change» function in google sheet to delete links, garbage words (like, follow us in…).
